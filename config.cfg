# Short description of the bot
description = Useful script to improve both your attacking and defensive skills. To use it, enable the script, and have no bots on either team. Press backspace to reset your shot. There is rudimentary support for mutators and other gamemodes.

# Fun fact about the bot
fun_fact = Has more bugs than you`d expect

backstory = Looking at my replays, i knew i was alright at defense, but terrible at offence. So to improve that, i looked for ways to practicing offense (aside from just playing matches). I tried those, and found that although I could hit good shots in freeplay and practice, they never worked in real matches. This was the goal of the script, to gauge the strength of my offense myself, by testing it against my own defense.
